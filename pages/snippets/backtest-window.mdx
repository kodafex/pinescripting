By default, when backtesting a strategy, all bars are taken into account.
If you want to look at the performance over a specific time frame you need to
add this to your script yourself.

This snippet allows you to set a start and end day/month/year, and strategy trades
are only executed if when they are within the time window.

```python
# inputs to define the start date and end date
FromMonth = input(defval=6, title="From Month", minval=1, maxval=12)
FromDay = input(defval=1, title="From Day", minval=1, maxval=31)
FromYear = input(defval=2019, title="From Year", minval=2014)
ToMonth = input(defval=1, title="To Month", minval=1, maxval=12)
ToDay = input(defval=1, title="To Day", minval=1, maxval=31)
ToYear = input(defval=9999, title="To Year", minval=2014)

# windowStart and windowEnd are time values
# corresponding to the start and end dates
windowStart = timestamp(FromYear, FromMonth, FromDay, 00, 00)
windowEnd = timestamp(ToYear, ToMonth, ToDay, 23, 59)

# inTimeWindow will be true if the time for the
# current bar is within the start and end dates
inTimeWindow = time >= windowStart and time <= windowEnd
```
