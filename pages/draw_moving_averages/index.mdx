# Plotting Moving Averages

In this article we'll plot some moving averages.

I won't go into too much detail about moving averages, there are lots of resources out there already.
The average part of a moving average is pretty simple, add up all the numbers in a series, then divide by the number of items.
If the series you use is, let's say, the closing price of a stock on each of the previous 100 days, then you'll have a value for today 
that's the average price of the previous day. If you do that again tomorrow, the next day, etc. and you plot those averages, you have
a moving average.

What i described is a simple moving average, but there are other more complex forms. The exponential moving average gives more importance
to the most recent days.

## Simple Moving Average (SMA)

The pinescript ```sma()``` function calculates the simple moving average given a series, and a number of previous values to average over.
For example, ```sma(close, 20)``` computes the simple moving average of closing prices where each value is the average of the previous 
20 bars.

|   Function    |   Example             |
|---------------|-----------------------|
|   ```sma()``` | ```sma(close, 20)```  |
|   ema()       |   ema(close, 20)  |
|   wma()       |   wma(close, 20)  |
